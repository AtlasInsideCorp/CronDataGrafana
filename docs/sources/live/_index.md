# Grafana Live overview

Grafana Live is a real-time messaging engine introduced in Grafana v8.

With Grafana Live it's possible to push event data to a frontend as soon as some event happened. This could be notifications about dashboard changes, new frames for rendered data etc.

Live features can help to eliminate a page reloads and polling in many places.
